## DIY 1W LORA Node for Meshtastic

A Meshtastic project using a 30dbm (1W) LORA Radio (E22-900M30S) and an EPS32-DEVKIT-V1.  The circuit also adds four I2C ports for other sensors like a BME280 enviromental sensor, or any other sensor suported by Meshtastic.  There is also a TTL serial port for use with a GPS module and a ssd1306 connector if a Oled screen is wanted.

I've used this for both mobile and fixed operations with good luck.  There are STL files for a 3d printing a simple enclosure for the PCB.
